  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  <p>
    Because there are over 100,000 people in our database (some of which may be repeats),
    we've opted to limit our scope by first focusing on <b>directors only</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below, you will find data for all directors going back to 1800.

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    Here it is...
  </p>
  <div class="table-container" style="max-height:750px;">
      {{ data|safe }}
  </div>
